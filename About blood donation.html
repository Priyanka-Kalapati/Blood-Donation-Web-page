    <h2>What is Blood Donation?</h2>
    <p>Blood donation is a voluntary process where individuals donate their blood for use in healthcare treatments and emergencies. Donated blood can help save lives by replenishing the blood supply for patients in need of transfusions due to illness or injury.</p>

    <h2>Why Donate Blood?</h2>
    <p>Donating blood is an altruistic act that can make a significant impact on the lives of others. Blood transfusions are essential for various medical procedures, including surgeries, trauma care, cancer treatment, and treatment for chronic illnesses like thalassemia and sickle cell disease. By donating blood, you can help ensure an adequate supply of blood for those in need and potentially save lives.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Donate Blood?</h2>
    <p>Most people are eligible to donate blood if they meet certain criteria, including being in good health, at least 17 years old (or 16 with parental consent in some regions), and meeting weight requirements. However, eligibility criteria may vary depending on factors such as medical history, recent travel, and lifestyle choices.</p>

    <h2>How to Donate Blood?</h2>
    <p>To donate blood, individuals typically need to visit a blood donation center or mobile blood drive. The process involves registration, a brief medical screening to ensure eligibility and safety, the blood donation itself, and post-donation refreshments. The entire process usually takes less than an hour, and donors are encouraged to hydrate and eat before and after donating.</p>
